## Trtl3

**Trtl3**üê¢ is a file storage service designed for beginner developers who want to learn how object storage works in practice ‚Äî without
the complexity of cloud services or external dependencies.

If you're building or experimenting with file uploads, downloads, and basic file organization via HTTP ‚Äî Trtl3 is a great starting point!

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

After Install Docker/Docker Compose you can install trtl3 using this command:

```bash
docker run -d --name trtl3 -p 7713:7713 -e TOKEN=your_secret_token nothiaki/trtl3:latest
```

So the service will be running on `http://localhost:7713/` and you can use by REST or use SDK's.

If you want to use docker compose you can add it on the file:

```yaml
services:

  trtl3:
    image: nothiaki/trtl3:latest
    ports:
      - 7713:7713
    environment:
      - TOKEN=your_token_here
```

So you can use it with SDK's or REST.
