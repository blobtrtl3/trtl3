## Getting Started

After Install Docker/Docker Compose you can install TRTL3 using this command:

```bash
docker run -d --name trtl3 -p 7713:7713 -e TOKEN=your_secret_token nothiaki/trtl3:latest
```

So the service will be running on `http://localhost:7713/` and you can use by REST or use SDK's.

If you want to use docker compose you can add it on the file:

```yaml
services:

  trtl3:
    image: nothiaki/trtl3:latest
    ports:
      - 7713:7713
    environment:
      - TOKEN=your_token_here
      - WORKERS=10
```

### üîß Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `TOKEN` | Authentication token for API access | `trtl3` |
| `WORKERS` | Number of worker threads for file processing | `10` |
| `JOB_INTERVAL` | Cleanup job interval in minutes | `5` |
